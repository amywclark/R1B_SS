          lo! the spear-danes' glory through splendid achievements          the folk-kings' former fame we have heard of,          how princes displayed then their prowess-in-battle.          oft scyld the scefing from scathers in numbers       from many a people their mead-benches tore.          since first he found him friendless and wretched,          the earl had had terror: comfort he got for it,          waxed 'neath the welkin, world-honor gained,          till all his neighbors o'er sea were compelled to       bow to his bidding and bring him their tribute:          an excellent atheling! after was borne him          a son and heir, young in his dwelling,          whom god-father sent to solace the people.          he had marked the misery malice had caused them,         that reaved of their rulers they wretched had erstwhile          long been afflicted. the lord, in requital,          wielder of glory, with world-honor blessed him.          famed was beowulf, far spread the glory          of scyld's great son in the lands of the danemen.so the carle that is young, by kindnesses rendered          the friends of his father, with fees in abundance          must be able to earn that when age approacheth          eager companions aid him requitingly,          when war assaults him serve him as liegemen:by praise-worthy actions must honor be got          'mong all of the races. at the hour that was fated          scyld then departed to the all-father's keeping          warlike to wend him; away then they bare him          to the flood of the current, his fond-loving comrades,as himself he had bidden, while the friend of the scyldings          word-sway wielded, and the well-lovèd land-prince          long did rule them.[3] the ring-stemmèd vessel,          bark of the atheling, lay there at anchor,          icy in glimmer and eager for sailing;the belovèd leader laid they down there,          giver of rings, on the breast of the vessel,          the famed by the mainmast. a many of jewels,          of fretted embossings, from far-lands brought over,          was placed near at hand then; and heard i not ever      that a folk ever furnished a float more superbly          with weapons of warfare, weeds for the battle,          bills and burnies; on his bosom sparkled          many a jewel that with him must travel          on the flush of the flood afar on the current.and favors no fewer they furnished him soothly,          excellent folk-gems, than others had given him          who when first he was born outward did send him          lone on the main, the merest of infants:          and a gold-fashioned standard they stretched under heavenhigh o'er his head, let the holm-currents bear him,          seaward consigned him: sad was their spirit,          their mood very mournful. men are not able          soothly to tell us, they in halls who reside,          heroes under heaven, to what haven he hied.          in the boroughs then beowulf, bairn of the scyldings,          belovèd land-prince, for long-lasting season          was famed mid the folk (his father departed,          the prince from his dwelling), till afterward sprang       great-minded healfdene; the danes in his lifetime          he graciously governed, grim-mooded, agèd.          four bairns of his body born in succession          woke in the world, war-troopers' leader          heorogar, hrothgar, and halga the good;heard i that elan was ongentheow's consort,          the well-beloved bedmate of the war-scylfing leader.          then glory in battle to hrothgar was given,          waxing of war-fame, that willingly kinsmen          obeyed his bidding, till the boys grew to manhood,       a numerous band.  it burned in his spirit          to urge his folk to found a great building,          a mead-hall grander than men of the era          ever had heard of, and in it to share          with young and old all of the blessings        the lord had allowed him, save life and retainers.          then the work i find afar was assignedto many races in middle-earth's regions,          to adorn the great folk-hall. in due time it happened          early 'mong men, that 'twas finished entirely,       the greatest of hall-buildings; heorot he named it          who wide-reaching word-sway wielded 'mong earlmen.          his promise he brake not, rings he lavished,          treasure at banquet. towered the hall up          high and horn-crested, huge between antlers:      it battle-waves bided, the blasting fire-demon;          ere long then from hottest hatred must sword-wrath          arise for a woman's husband and father.          then the mighty war-spiritendured for a season,          bore it bitterly, he who bided in darkness,       that light-hearted laughter loud in the building          greeted him daily; there was dulcet harp-music,          clear song of the singer. he said that was able          to tell from of old earthmen's beginnings,          that father almighty earth had created,the winsome wold that the water encircleth,          set exultingly the sun's and the moon's beams          to lavish their lustre on land-folk and races,          and earth he embellished in all her regions          with limbs and leaves; life he bestowed tooon all the kindreds that live under heaven.          so blessed with abundance, brimming with joyance,          the warriors abided, till a certain one gan to          dog them with deeds of direfullest malice,          a foe in the hall-building: this horrible stranger      was grendel entitled, the march-stepper famous          who[3] dwelt in the moor-fens, the marsh and the fastness;          the wan-mooded being abode for a seasonin the land of the giants, when the lord and creator          had banned him and branded. for that bitter murder,      the killing of abel, all-ruling father          the kindred of cain crushed with his vengeance;          in the feud he rejoiced not, but far away drove him          from kindred and kind, that crime to atone for,          meter of justice. thence ill-favored creatures,       elves and giants, monsters of ocean,          came into being, and the giants that longtime          grappled with god; he gave them requital.          when the sun was sunken, he set out to visit          the lofty hall-building, how the ring-danes had used it          for beds and benches when the banquet was over.          then he found there reposing many a noble       asleep after supper; sorrow the heroes,          misery knew not. the monster of evil          greedy and cruel tarried but little,          fell and frantic, and forced from their slumbers          thirty of thanemen; thence he departed      leaping and laughing, his lair to return to,          with surfeit of slaughter sallying homeward.          in the dusk of the dawning, as the day was just breaking,          was grendel's prowess revealed to the warriors:          then, his meal-taking finished, a moan was uplifted,        morning-cry mighty. the man-ruler famous,          the long-worthy atheling, sat very woful,          suffered great sorrow, sighed for his liegemen,when they had seen the track of the hateful pursuer,          the spirit accursèd: too crushing that sorrow,too loathsome and lasting. not longer he tarried,          but one night after continued his slaughter          shameless and shocking, shrinking but little          from malice and murder; they mastered him fully.          he was easy to find then who otherwhere looked fora pleasanter place of repose in the lodges,          a bed in the bowers. then was brought to his notice          told him truly by token apparent          the hall-thane's hatred: he held himself after          further and faster who the foeman did baffle.so ruled he and strongly strove against justice          lone against all men, till empty uptowered          the choicest of houses. long was the season:          twelve-winters' time torture suffered          the friend of the scyldings, every affliction,       endless agony; hence it after became          certainly known to the children of men          sadly in measures, that long against hrothgar          grendel struggled:--his grudges he cherished,          murderous malice, many a winter,       strife unremitting, and peacefully wished he         life-woe to lift from no liegeman at all of          the men of the dane-folk, for money to settle,          no counsellor needed count for a momenton handsome amends at the hands of the murderer;the monster of evil fiercely did harass,          the ill-planning death-shade, both elder and younger,          trapping and tricking them. he trod every night then          the mist-covered moor-fens; men do not know where          witches and wizards wander and ramble.so the foe of mankind many of evils          grievous injuries, often accomplished,          horrible hermit; heort he frequented,          gem-bedecked palace, when night-shades had fallen          (since god did oppose him, not the throne could he touch,[5]the light-flashing jewel, love of him knew not).          'twas a fearful affliction to the friend of the scyldings          soul-crushing sorrow. not seldom in private          sat the king in his council; conference held they          what the braves should determine 'gainst terrors unlooked for.at the shrines of their idols often they promised          gifts and offerings, earnestly prayed they          the devil from hell would help them to lighten          their people's oppression. such practice they used then,          hope of the heathen; hell they rememberedin innermost spirit, god they knew not,          judge of their actions, all-wielding ruler,          no praise could they give the guardian of heaven,          the wielder of glory. woe will be his who          through furious hatred his spirit shall drive tothe clutch of the fire, no comfort shall look for,          wax no wiser; well for the man who,          living his life-days, his lord may face          and find defence in his father's embrace!          so healfdene's kinsman constantly mused on          his long-lasting sorrow; the battle-thane clever          was not anywise able evils to 'scape from:          too crushing the sorrow that came to the people,       loathsome and lasting the life-grinding torture,          greatest of night-woes. so higelac's liegeman,          good amid geatmen, of grendel's achievements          heard in his home: of heroes then living          he was stoutest and strongest, sturdy and noble.he bade them prepare him a bark that was trusty;          he said he the war-king would seek o'er the ocean,          the folk-leader noble, since he needed retainers.          for the perilous project prudent companions          chided him little, though loving him dearly;       they egged the brave atheling, augured him glory.          the excellent knight from the folk of the geatmen          had liegemen selected, likest to prove them          trustworthy warriors; with fourteen companions          the vessel he looked for; a liegeman then showed them,      a sea-crafty man, the bounds of the country.          fast the days fleeted; the float was a-water,          the craft by the cliff. clomb to the prow then          well-equipped warriors: the wave-currents twisted          the sea on the sand; soldiers then carried      on the breast of the vessel bright-shining jewels,          handsome war-armor; heroes outshoved then,          warmen the wood-ship, on its wished-for adventure.          the foamy-necked floater fanned by the breeze,          likest a bird, glided the waters,till twenty and four hours thereafter          the twist-stemmed vessel had traveled such distance          that the sailing-men saw the sloping embankments,          the sea cliffs gleaming, precipitous mountains,          nesses enormous: they were nearing the limitsat the end of the ocean. up thence quickly          the men of the weders clomb to the mainland,          fastened their vessel (battle weeds rattled,          war burnies clattered), the wielder they thanked          that the ways o'er the waters had waxen so gentle.then well from the cliff edge the guard of the scyldings          who the sea-cliffs should see to, saw o'er the gangway          brave ones bearing beauteous targets,          armor all ready, anxiously thought he,          musing and wondering what men were approaching.        high on his horse then hrothgar's retainer          turned him to coastward, mightily brandished          his lance in his hands, questioned with boldness.          "who are ye men here, mail-covered warriors          clad in your corslets, come thus a-drivinga high riding ship o'er the shoals of the waters,and hither 'neath helmets have hied o'er the ocean?i have been strand-guard, standing as warden,          lest enemies ever anywise ravage          danish dominions with army of war-ships.more boldly never have warriors ventured          hither to come;

many a winter          he lived with the people, ere he passed on his journey,          old from his dwelling; each of the counsellors          widely mid world-folk well remembers him.we, kindly of spirit, the lord of thy people,          the son of king healfdene, have come here to visit,folk-troop's defender: be free in thy counsels!          to the noble one bear we a weighty commission,          the helm of the danemen;

the truth is established          that god almighty hath governed for ages          kindreds and nations. a night very lurid          the trav'ler-at-twilight came tramping and striding.          the warriors were sleeping who should watch the horned-building,one only excepted. 'mid earthmen 'twas 'stablished,          th' implacable foeman was powerless to hurl them          to the land of shadows, if the lord were unwilling;          but serving as warder, in terror to foemen,          he angrily bided the issue of battle.          'neath the cloudy cliffs came from the moor then          grendel going, god's anger bare he.          the monster intended some one of earthmen          in the hall-building grand to entrap and make way with:he went under welkin where well he knew of          the wine-joyous building, brilliant with plating,          gold-hall of earthmen. not the earliest occasionhe the home and manor of hrothgar had sought:          ne'er found he in life-days later nor earlier       hardier hero, hall-thanes more sturdy!          then came to the building the warrior marching,          bereft of his joyance. the door quickly opened          on fire-hinges fastened, when his fingers had touched it;          the fell one had flung then--his fury so bitter--open the entrance. early thereafter          the foeman trod the shining hall-pavement,          strode he angrily; from the eyes of him glimmered          a lustre unlovely likest to fire.          he beheld in the hall the heroes in numbers,a circle of kinsmen sleeping together,a throng of thanemen: then his thoughts were exultant,          he minded to sunder from each of the thanemen          the life from his body, horrible demon,          ere morning came, since fate had allowed himthe prospect of plenty. providence willed not          to permit him any more of men under heaven          to eat in the night-time. higelac's kinsman          great sorrow endured how the dire-mooded creaturein unlooked-for assaults were likely to bear him.no thought had the monster of deferring the matter,but on earliest occasion he quickly laid hold of          a soldier asleep, suddenly tore him,          bit his bone-prison, the blood drank in currents,          swallowed in mouthfuls: he soon had the dead man'sfeet and hands, too, eaten entirely.          nearer he strode then, the stout-hearted warriorsnatched as he slumbered, seizing with hand-grip,          forward the foeman foined with his hand;          caught he quickly the cunning deviser,      on his elbow he rested. this early discovered          the master of malice, that in middle-earth's regions,          'neath the whole of the heavens, no hand-grapple greaterin any man else had he ever encountered:          fearful in spirit, faint-mooded waxed he,       not off could betake him; death he was pondering,would fly to his covert, seek the devils' assembly:          his calling no more was the same he had followed          long in his lifetime. the liege-kinsman worthyof higelac minded his speech of the evening,stood he up straight and stoutly did seize him.          his fingers crackled; the giant was outward,          the earl stepped farther. the famous one minded          to flee away farther, if he found an occasion,          and off and away, avoiding delay,to fly to the fen-moors; he fully was ware of          the strength of his grapple in the grip of the foeman.'twas an ill-taken journey that the injury-bringing,          harrying harmer to heorot wandered:the palace re-echoed; to all of the danemen,dwellers in castles, to each of the bold ones,          earlmen, was terror. angry they both were,          archwarders raging. rattled the building;'twas a marvellous wonder that the wine-hall withstood then          the bold-in-battle, bent not to earthward,excellent earth-hall; but within and without it          was fastened so firmly in fetters of iron,          by the art of the armorer. off from the sill there          bent mead-benches many, as men have informed me,          adorned with gold-work, where the grim ones did struggle.the scylding wise men weened ne'er before          that by might and main-strength a man under heaven          might break it in pieces, bone-decked, resplendent,          crush it by cunning, unless clutch of the fire          in smoke should consume it. the sound mounted upwardnovel enough; on the north danes fastened          a terror of anguish, on all of the men there          who heard from the wall the weeping and plaining,          the song of defeat from the foeman of heaven,          heard him hymns of horror howl, and his sorrow       hell-bound bewailing. he held him too firmly          who was strongest of main-strength of men of that era.for no cause whatever would the earlmen's defender          leave in life-joys the loathsome newcomer,          he deemed his existence utterly useless          to men under heaven. many a noble         of beowulf brandished his battle-sword old,          would guard the life of his lord and protector,          the far-famous chieftain, if able to do so;          while waging the warfare, this wist they but little,          brave battle-thanes, while his body intendingto slit into slivers, and seeking his spirit:          that the relentless foeman nor finest of weapons          of all on the earth, nor any of war-billswas willing to injure; but weapons of victory          swords and suchlike he had sworn to dispense with.his death at that time must prove to be wretched,          and the far-away spirit widely should journey          into enemies' power. this plainly he saw then          who with mirth of mood malice no little          had wrought in the past on the race of the earthmen       (to god he was hostile), that his body would fail him,          but higelac's hardy henchman and kinsman          held him by the hand; hateful to otherwas each one if living. a body-wound suffered          the direful demon, damage incurablewas seen on his shoulder, his sinews were shivered,          his body did burst. to beowulf was given          glory in battle;

he set out then banished,          marked as a murderer, man-joys avoiding,lived in the desert. thence demons unnumberedfate-sent awoke; one of them grendel,          sword-cursèd, hateful, who at heorot met with          a man that was watching, waiting the struggle,          where a horrid one held him with hand-grapple sturdy;nathless he minded the might of his body,          the glorious gift god had allowed him,          and folk-ruling father's favor relied on,          his help and his comfort: so he conquered the foeman,          the hell-spirit humbled: he unhappy departed then,reaved of his joyance, journeying to death-haunts,          foeman of man. his mother moreovereager and gloomy was anxious to go on          her mournful mission, mindful of vengeance          for the death of her son. she came then to heorotwhere the armor-dane earlmen all through the building          were lying in slumber. soon there became then          return to the nobles, when the mother of grendel          entered the folk-hall; the fear was less grievous          by even so much as the vigor of maidens,war-strength of women, by warrior is reckoned,          when well-carved weapon, worked with the hammer,          blade very bloody, brave with its edges,          strikes down the boar-sign that stands on the helmet.          then the hard-edgèd weapon was heaved in the building,the brand o'er the benches, broad-lindens many          hand-fast were lifted; for helmet he recked not,          for armor-net broad, whom terror laid hold of.          she went then hastily, outward would get her          her life for to save, when some one did spy her;soon she had grappled one of the athelings          fast and firmly, when fenward she hied her;          that one to hrothgar was liefest of heroes          in rank of retainer where waters encircle,          a mighty shield-warrior, whom she murdered at slumber,a broadly-famed battle-knight. beowulf was absent,but another apartment was erstwhile devoted          to the glory-decked geatman when gold was distributed.          there was hubbub in heorot. the hand that was famous          she grasped in its gore; grief was renewed thenin homes and houses: 'twas no happy arrangement          in both of the quarters to barter and purchase          with lives of their friends. then the well-agèd ruler,          the gray-headed war-thane, was woful in spirit,          when his long-trusted liegeman lifeless he knew of,his dearest one gone. quick from a room was          beowulf brought, brave and triumphant.          as day was dawning in the dusk of the morning,          went then that earlman, champion noble,          came with comrades, where the clever one bidedwhether god all gracious would grant him a respite          after the woe he had suffered. the war-worthy hero          with a troop of retainers trod then the pavement          (the hall-building groaned), till he greeted the wise one,the earl of the ingwins; asked if the night hadfully refreshed him, as fain he would have it.hrothgar rejoined, helm of the scyldings:          "ask not of joyance! grief is renewed to          the folk of the danemen. dead is Æschere,          yrmenlaf's brother, older than he,my true-hearted counsellor, trusty adviser,          shoulder-companion, when fighting in battle          our heads we protected, when troopers were clashing,and heroes were dashing; such an earl should be ever,          an erst-worthy atheling, as Æschere proved him.the flickering death-spirit became in heorot          his hand-to-hand murderer; i can not tell whither          the cruel one turned in the carcass exulting,by cramming discovered. the quarrel she wreaked then,          that last night igone grendel thou killedstin gruesomest manner, with grim-holding clutches,          since too long he had lessened my liege-troop and wasted          my folk-men so foully. he fell in the battle          with forfeit of life, and another has followed,          a mighty crime-worker, her kinsman avenging,and henceforth hath 'stablished her hatred unyielding,          as it well may appear to many a liegeman,          who mourneth in spirit the treasure-bestower,          her heavy heart-sorrow; the hand is now lifeless          which availed you in every wish that you cherished.land-people heard i, liegemen, this saying,          dwellers in halls, they had seen very often          a pair of such mighty march-striding creatures,          far-dwelling spirits, holding the moorlands:          one of them wore, as well they might notice,the image of woman, the other one wretched          in guise of a man wandered in exile,          except he was huger than any of earthmen;          earth-dwelling people entitled him grendel          in days of yore: they know not their father,whe'r ill-going spirits any were borne himever before. they guard the wolf-coverts,          lands inaccessible, wind-beaten nesses,          fearfullest fen-deeps, where a flood from the mountains          'neath mists of the nesses netherward rattles,the stream under earth: not far is it henceward          measured by mile-lengths that the mere-water standeth,          which forests hang over, with frost-whiting covered,a firm-rooted forest, the floods overshadow.          there ever at night one an ill-meaning portenta fire-flood may see; 'mong children of men          none liveth so wise that wot of the bottom;          though harassed by hounds the heath-stepper seek for,          fly to the forest, firm-antlered he-deer,          spurred from afar, his spirit he yieldeth,his life on the shore, ere in he will venture          to cover his head. uncanny the place is:          thence upward ascendeth the surging of waters,          wan to the welkin, when the wind is stirring          the weathers unpleasing, till the air groweth gloomy,and the heavens lower. now is help to be gotten          from thee and thee only! the abode thou know'st not,          the dangerous place where thou'rt able to meet with          the sin-laden hero: seek if thou darest!          for the feud i will fully fee thee with money,with old-time treasure, as erstwhile i did thee,          with well-twisted jewels, if away thou shalt get thee."beowulf answered, ecgtheow's son:          "grieve not, o wise one! for each it is better,          his friend to avenge than with vehemence wail him;          each of us must the end-day abide ofhis earthly existence; who is able accomplish          glory ere death! to battle-thane noble          lifeless lying, 'tis at last most fitting.          arise, o king, quick let us hasten          to look at the footprint of the kinsman of grendel!i promise thee this now: to his place he'll escape not,          to embrace of the earth, nor to mountainous forest,          nor to depths of the ocean, wherever he wanders.practice thou now patient endurance          of each of thy sorrows, as i hope for thee soothly!"then up sprang the old one, the all-wielder thanked he,          ruler almighty, that the man had outspoken.          then for hrothgar a war-horse was decked with a bridle,          curly-maned courser. the clever folk-leaderstately proceeded: stepped then an earl-troopof linden-wood bearers. her footprints were seen then          widely in wood-paths, her way o'er the bottoms,          where she faraway fared o'er fen-country murky,          bore away breathless the best of retainers          who pondered with hrothgar the welfare of country.the son of the athelings then went o'er the stony,          declivitous cliffs, the close-covered passes,          narrow passages, paths unfrequented,          nesses abrupt, nicker-haunts many;          one of a few of wise-mooded heroes,he onward advanced to view the surroundings,          till he found unawares woods of the mountain          o'er hoar-stones hanging, holt-wood unjoyful;          the water stood under, welling and gory.          'twas irksome in spirit to all of the danemen,friends of the scyldings, to many a liegemansad to be suffered, a sorrow unlittle          to each of the earlmen, when to Æschere's head they          came on the cliff. the current was seething          with blood and with gore (the troopers gazed on it).the horn anon sang the battle-song ready.          the troop were all seated; they saw 'long the water then          many a serpent, mere-dragons wondrous          trying the waters, nickers a-lying          on the cliffs of the nesses, which at noonday full oftengo on the sea-deeps their sorrowful journey,          wild-beasts and wormkind; away then they hastenedhot-mooded, hateful, they heard the great clamor,          the war-trumpet winding. one did the geat-princesunder from earth-joys, with arrow from bowstring,from his sea-struggle tore him, that the trusty war-missile          pierced to his vitals; he proved in the currents          less doughty at swimming whom death had offcarried.          soon in the waters the wonderful swimmer          was straitened most sorely with sword-pointed boar-spears,pressed in the battle and pulled to the cliff-edge;          the liegemen then looked on the loath-fashioned stranger.          beowulf donned then his battle-equipments,          cared little for life; inlaid and most ample,          the hand-woven corslet which could cover his body,must the wave-deeps explore, that war might be powerless          to harm the great hero, and the hating one's grasp might          not peril his safety; his head was protected          by the light-flashing helmet that should mix with the bottoms,          trying the eddies, treasure-emblazoned,encircled with jewels, as in seasons long past          the weapon-smith worked it, wondrously made it,          with swine-bodies fashioned it, that thenceforward no longer          brand might bite it, and battle-sword hurt it.          and that was not least of helpers in prowessthat hrothgar's spokesman had lent him when straitened;          and the hilted hand-sword was hrunting entitled,          old and most excellent 'mong all of the treasures;          its blade was of iron, blotted with poison,          hardened with gore; it failed not in battleany hero under heaven in hand who it brandished,          who ventured to take the terrible journeys,          the battle-field sought; not the earliest occasion          that deeds of daring 'twas destined to 'complish.ecglaf's kinsman minded not soothly,exulting in strength, what erst he had spoken          drunken with wine, when the weapon he lent to          a sword-hero bolder; himself did not venture          'neath the strife of the currents his life to endanger,to fame-deeds perform; there he forfeited glory,repute for his strength. not so with the other          when he clad in his corslet had equipped him for battle.          beowulf spake, ecgtheow's son:          "recall now, oh, famous kinsman of healfdene,          prince very prudent, now to part i am ready,          gold-friend of earlmen, what erst we agreed on,should i lay down my life in lending thee assistance,          when my earth-joys were over, thou wouldst evermore serve me          in stead of a father; my faithful thanemen,          my trusty retainers, protect thou and care for,          fall i in battle: and, hrothgar belovèd,send unto higelac the high-valued jewels          thou to me hast allotted. the lord of the geatmen          may perceive from the gold, the hrethling may see itwhen he looks on the jewels, that a gem-giver found i          good over-measure, enjoyed him while able.and the ancient heirloom unferth permit thou,          the famed one to have, the heavy-sword splendid          the hard-edgèd weapon; with hrunting to aid me,          i shall gain me glory, or grim-death shall take me."the atheling of geatmen uttered these words andheroic did hasten, not any rejoinder          was willing to wait for; the wave-current swallowed          the doughty-in-battle. then a day's-length elapsed ere          he was able to see the sea at its bottom.          early she found then who fifty of wintersthe course of the currents kept in her fury,          grisly and greedy, that the grim one's dominion          some one of men from above was exploring.          forth did she grab them, grappled the warrior          with horrible clutches; yet no sooner she injuredhis body unscathèd: the burnie out-guarded,          that she proved but powerless to pierce through the armor,          the limb-mail locked, with loath-grabbing fingers.          the sea-wolf bare then, when bottomward came she,          the ring-prince homeward, that he after was powerless (he had daring to do it) to deal with his weapons,          but many a mere-beast tormented him swimming,          flood-beasts no few with fierce-biting tusks did          break through his burnie, the brave one pursued they.          the earl then discovered he was down in some cavernwhere no water whatever anywise harmed him,          and the clutch of the current could come not anear him,          since the roofed-hall prevented; brightness a-gleaming          fire-light he saw, flashing resplendent.          the good one saw then the sea-bottom's monster,the mighty mere-woman; he made a great onset          with weapon-of-battle, his hand not desisted          from striking, that war-blade struck on her head then          a battle-song greedy. the stranger perceived then          the sword would not bite, her life would not injure,but the falchion failed the folk-prince when straitened:          erst had it often onsets encountered,          oft cloven the helmet, the fated one's armor:          'twas the first time that ever the excellent jewel          had failed of its fame. firm-mooded after,not heedless of valor, but mindful of glory,          was higelac's kinsman; the hero-chief angry          cast then his carved-sword covered with jewels          that it lay on the earth, hard and steel-pointed;          he hoped in his strength, his hand-grapple sturdy.so any must act whenever he thinketh          to gain him in battle glory unending,          and is reckless of living. the lord of the war-geats (he shrank not from battle) seized by the shoulder          the mother of grendel; then mighty in struggleswung he his enemy, since his anger was kindled,          that she fell to the floor. with furious grapple          she gave him requital early thereafter,          and stretched out to grab him; the strongest of warriors          faint-mooded stumbled, till he fell in his traces,foot-going champion. then she sat on the hall-guest          and wielded her war-knife wide-bladed, flashing,          for her son would take vengeance, her one only bairn.his breast-armor woven bode on his shoulder;          it guarded his life, the entrance defended'gainst sword-point and edges. ecgtheow's son there          had fatally journeyed, champion of geatmen,          in the arms of the ocean, had the armor not given,          close-woven corslet, comfort and succor,          and had god most holy not awarded the victory,all-knowing lord; easily did heaven's          ruler most righteous arrange it with justice;          uprose he erect ready for battle.then he saw mid the war-gems a weapon of victory,          an ancient giant-sword, of edges a-doughty,          glory of warriors: of weapons 'twas choicest,          only 'twas larger than any man else wasable to bear to the battle-encounter,          the good and splendid work of the giants.          he grasped then the sword-hilt, knight of the scyldings,          bold and battle-grim, brandished his ring-sword,          hopeless of living, hotly he smote her,that the fiend-woman's neck firmly it grappled,          broke through her bone-joints, the bill fully pierced her          fate-cursèd body, she fell to the ground then:          the hand-sword was bloody, the hero exulted.          the brand was brilliant, brightly it glimmered,just as from heaven gemlike shineth          the torch of the firmament. he glanced 'long the building,          and turned by the wall then, higelac's vassal          raging and wrathful raised his battle-sword          strong by the handle. the edge was not uselessto the hero-in-battle, but he speedily wished to          give grendel requital for the many assaults he          had worked on the west-danes not once, but often,          when he slew in slumber the subjects of hrothgar,          swallowed down fifteen sleeping retainersof the folk of the danemen, and fully as many          carried away, a horrible prey.          he gave him requital, grim-raging champion,when he saw on his rest-place weary of conflict          grendel lying, of life-joys bereavèd,as the battle at heorot erstwhile had scathed him;          his body far bounded, a blow when he suffered,          death having seized him, sword-smiting heavy,          and he cut off his head then. early this noticed          the clever carles who as comrades of hrothgargazed on the sea-deeps, that the surging wave-currents          were mightily mingled, the mere-flood was gory:          of the good one the gray-haired together held converse,the hoary of head, that they hoped not to see again          the atheling ever, that exulting in victoryhe'd return there to visit the distinguished folk-ruler:then many concluded the mere-wolf had killed him.          the ninth hour came then. from the ness-edge departed          the bold-mooded scyldings; the gold-friend of heroes          homeward betook him. the strangers sat down thensoul-sick, sorrowful, the sea-waves regarding:          they wished and yet weened not their well-loved friend-lordto see any more. the sword-blade began then,          the blood having touched it, contracting and shriveling          with battle-icicles;

oft light-ringing harp-strings,          joy-telling wood, were touched by the brave one;now he uttered measures, mourning and truthful,          then the large-hearted land-king a legend of wonder          truthfully told us. now troubled with yearsthe age-hoary warrior afterward began to          mourn for the might that marked him in youth-days;his breast within boiled, when burdened with winters          much he remembered. from morning till night then          we joyed us therein as etiquette suffered,          till the second night season came unto earth-folk.          then early thereafter, the mother of grendelwas ready for vengeance, wretched she journeyed;          her son had death ravished, the wrath of the geatmen.          the horrible woman avengèd her offspring,          and with mighty mainstrength murdered a hero.there the spirit of Æschere, agèd adviser,was ready to vanish; nor when morn had lightened          were they anywise suffered to consume him with fire,          folk of the danemen, the death-weakened hero,          nor the belovèd liegeman to lay on the pyre;she the corpse had offcarried in the clutch of the foeman'neath mountain-brook's flood. to hrothgar 'twas saddest          of pains that ever had preyed on the chieftain;          by the life of thee the land-prince then me          besought very sadly, in sea-currents' eddies          to display my prowess, to peril my safety,might-deeds accomplish; much did he promise.i found then the famous flood-current's cruel,          horrible depth-warder. a while unto us twohand was in common; the currents were seething          with gore that was clotted, and grendel's fierce mother'shead i offhacked in the hall at the bottom          with huge-reaching sword-edge, hardly i wrested          my life from her clutches; not doomed was i then,but the warden of earlmen afterward gave me          jewels in quantity, kinsman of healfdene."so the belovèd land-prince lived in decorum;          i had missed no rewards, no meeds of my prowess,          but he gave me jewels, regarding my wishes,          healfdene his bairn; i'll bring them to thee, then,atheling of earlmen, offer them gladly.          and still unto thee is all my affection:          but few of my folk-kin find i surviving          but thee, dear higelac!" bade he in then to carry          the boar-image, banner, battle-high helmet,iron-gray armor, the excellent weapon,in song-measures said: "this suit-for-the-battle          hrothgar presented me, bade me expressly,          wise-mooded atheling, thereafter to tell thee          the whole of its history, said king heregar owned it,dane-prince for long: yet he wished not to give thenthe mail to his son, though dearly he loved him,          hereward the hardy. hold all in joyance!"          i heard that there followed hard on the jewels          two braces of stallions of striking resemblance,dappled and yellow; he granted him usance          of horses and treasures. so a kinsman should bear him,          no web of treachery weave for another,          nor by cunning craftiness cause the destruction         of trusty companion. most precious to higelac,the bold one in battle, was the bairn of his sister,          and each unto other mindful of favors.           i am told that to hygd he proffered the necklace,          wonder-gem rare that wealhtheow gave him,          the troop-leader's daughter, a trio of horsesslender and saddle-bright; soon did the jewel          embellish her bosom, when the beer-feast was over.          so ecgtheow's bairn brave did prove him,war-famous man, by deeds that were valiant,          he lived in honor, belovèd companionsslew not carousing; his mood was not cruel,          but by hand-strength hugest of heroes then living          the brave one retained the bountiful gift that          the lord had allowed him. long was he wretched,          so that sons of the geatmen accounted him worthless,and the lord of the liegemen loth was to do him          mickle of honor, when mead-cups were passing;          they fully believed him idle and sluggish,an indolent atheling: to the honor-blest man there          came requital for the cuts he had suffered.the folk-troop's defender bade fetch to the building          the heirloom of hrethel, embellished with gold,          so the brave one enjoined it; there was jewel no richer          in the form of a weapon 'mong geats of that era;          in beowulf's keeping he placed it and gave himseven of thousands, manor and lordship.          common to both was land 'mong the people,estate and inherited rights and possessions,          to the second one specially spacious dominions,          to the one who was better. it afterward happenedin days that followed, befell the battle-thanes,after higelac's death, and when heardred was murdered          with weapons of warfare 'neath well-covered targets,          when valiant battlemen in victor-band sought him,          war-scylfing heroes harassed the nephewof hereric in battle. to beowulf's keeping          turned there in time extensive dominions:he fittingly ruled them a fifty of winters          (he a man-ruler wise was, manor-ward old) till          a certain one 'gan, on gloom-darkening nights, adragon, to govern, who guarded a treasure,          a high-rising stone-cliff, on heath that was grayish:          a path 'neath it lay, unknown unto mortals.          some one of earthmen entered the mountain,          the heathenish hoard laid hold of with ardor;          he sought of himself who sorely did harm him,          but, for need very pressing, the servant of one of          the sons of the heroes hate-blows evaded,        5 seeking for shelter and the sin-driven warrior          took refuge within there. he early looked in it,when the onset surprised him,he a gem-vessel saw there: many of suchlike          ancient ornaments in the earth-cave were lying,          as in days of yore some one of men of          illustrious lineage, as a legacy monstrous,          there had secreted them, careful and thoughtful,dear-valued jewels. death had offsnatched them,          in the days of the past, and the one man moreover          of the flower of the folk who fared there the longest,          was fain to defer it, friend-mourning warder,          a little longer to be left in enjoymentof long-lasting treasure. a barrow all-ready          stood on the plain the stream-currents nigh to,          new by the ness-edge, unnethe of approaching:          the keeper of rings carried within aponderous deal of the treasure of nobles,of gold that was beaten, briefly he spake then:          "hold thou, o earth, now heroes no more may,          the earnings of earlmen. lo! erst in thy bosom          worthy men won them;

harp-joy is vanished,          the rapture of glee-wood, no excellent falcon          swoops through the building, no swift-footed charger          grindeth the gravel. a grievous destructionno few of the world-folk widely hath scattered!"          so, woful of spirit one after all          lamented mournfully, moaning in sadness          by day and by night, till death with its billowsdashed on his spirit. then the ancient dusk-scatherfound the great treasure standing all open,          he who flaming and fiery flies to the barrows,          naked war-dragon, nightly escapeth          encompassed with fire; men under heaven          widely beheld him. 'tis said that he looks forthe hoard in the earth, where old he is guarding          the heathenish treasure; he'll be nowise the better.so three-hundred winters the waster of peoples          held upon earth that excellent hoard-hall,          till the forementioned earlman angered him bitterly:the beat-plated beaker he bare to his chieftain          and fullest remission for all his remissness          begged of his liegelord. then the hoard was discovered,          the treasure was taken, his petition was grantedthe lorn-mooded liegeman. his lord regardedthe old-work of earth-folk--'twas the earliest occasion.          when the dragon awoke, the strife was renewed there;          he snuffed 'long the stone then, stout-hearted found hethe footprint of foeman; too far had he gone          with cunning craftiness close to the head ofthe fire-spewing dragon. so undoomed he may 'scape from          anguish and exile with ease who possesseth          the favor of heaven. the hoard-warden eagerly          searched o'er the ground then, would meet with the person          that caused him sorrow while in slumber reclining:gleaming and wild he oft went round the cavern,          all of it outward; not any of earthmen          was seen in that desert. yet he joyed in the battle,          rejoiced in the conflict: oft he turned to the barrow,          sought for the gem-cup; this he soon perceived thenthat some man or other had discovered the gold,          the famous folk-treasure. not fain did the hoard-ward          wait until evening; then the ward of the barrow          was angry in spirit, the loathèd one wished to          pay for the dear-valued drink-cup with fire.then the day was done as the dragon would have it,          he no longer would wait on the wall, but departed          fire-impelled, flaming. fearful the start was          to earls in the land, as it early thereafter          to their giver-of-gold was grievously ended.the stranger began then to vomit forth fire,          to burn the great manor; the blaze then glimmered          for anguish to earlmen, not anything livingwas the hateful air-goer willing to leave there.the war of the worm widely was noticed,          the feud of the foeman afar and anear,          how the enemy injured the earls of the geatmen,          harried with hatred: back he hied to the treasure,          to the well-hidden cavern ere the coming of daylight.he had circled with fire the folk of those regions,          with brand and burning; in the barrow he trusted,          in the wall and his war-might: the weening deceived him.then straight was the horror to beowulf published,          early forsooth, that his own native homestead,the best of buildings, was burning and melting,          gift-seat of geatmen. 'twas a grief to the spirit          of the good-mooded hero, the greatest of sorrows:          the wise one weened then that wielding his kingdom          'gainst the ancient commandments, he had bitterly angeredthe lord everlasting: with lorn meditations          his bosom welled inward, as was nowise his custom.          the fire-spewing dragon fully had wasted          the fastness of warriors, the water-land outward,          the manor with fire. the folk-ruling hero,prince of the weders, was planning to wreak him.          the warmen's defender bade them to make him,          earlmen's atheling, an excellent war-shieldwholly of iron: fully he knew then          that wood from the forest was helpless to aid him,shield against fire. the long-worthy ruler          must live the last of his limited earth-days,          of life in the world and the worm along with him,          though he long had been holding hoard-wealth in plenty.then the ring-prince disdained to seek with a war-band,with army extensive, the air-going ranger;          he felt no fear of the foeman's assaults and          he counted for little the might of the dragon,his power and prowess: for previously dared hea heap of hostility, hazarded dangers,war-thane, when hrothgar's palace he cleansèd,          conquering combatant, clutched in the battle          the kinsmen of grendel, of kindred detested.          'twas of hand-fights not least where higelac was slaughtered,          when the king of the geatmen with clashings of battle,friend-lord of folks in frisian dominions,          offspring of hrethrel perished through sword-drink,          with battle-swords beaten; thence beowulf came then          on self-help relying, swam through the waters;          he bare on his arm, lone-going, thirtyoutfits of armor, when the ocean he mounted.          the hetwars by no means had need to be boastful          of their fighting afoot, who forward to meet him          carried their war-shields: not many returned from          the brave-mooded battle-knight back to their homesteads.lone-goer lorn to his land-folk returning,          where hygd to him tendered treasure and kingdom,          rings and dominion: her son she not trusted,          to be able to keep the kingdom devised him'gainst alien races, on the death of king higelac.          yet the sad ones succeeded not in persuading the atheling          in any way ever, to act as a suzerain          to heardred, or promise to govern the kingdom;          yet with friendly counsel in the folk he sustained him,gracious, with honor, till he grew to be older,wielded the weders. wide-fleeing outlaws,          ohthere's sons, sought him o'er the waters:          they had stirred a revolt 'gainst the helm of the scylfings,          the best of the sea-kings, who in swedish dominionsdistributed treasure, distinguished folk-leader.'twas the end of his earth-days; injury fatal          by swing of the sword he received as a greeting,          offspring of higelac; ongentheow's bairn          later departed to visit his homestead,when heardred was dead; let beowulf rule them,          govern the geatmen: good was that folk-king.he planned requital for the folk-leader's ruin          in days thereafter, to eadgils the wretched          becoming an enemy. ohthere's son then          went with a war-troop o'er the wide-stretching currents        5 with warriors and weapons: with woe-journeys cold he          after avenged him, the king's life he took.          so he came off uninjured from all of his battles,          perilous fights, offspring of ecgtheow,          from his deeds of daring, till that day most momentouswhen he fate-driven fared to fight with the dragon.with eleven companions the prince of the geatmen          went lowering with fury to look at the fire-drake:          inquiring he'd found how the feud had arisen,          hate to his heroes; the highly-famed gem-vesselwas brought to his keeping through the hand of th' informer.          that in the throng was thirteenth of heroes,          that caused the beginning of conflict so bitter,          captive and wretched, must sad-mooded thencewardpoint out the place: he passed then unwillinglyto the spot where he knew of the notable cavern,          the cave under earth, not far from the ocean,          the anger of eddies, which inward was full of          jewels and wires: a warden uncanny,warrior weaponed, wardered the treasure,old under earth; no easy possession          for any of earth-folk access to get to.          then the battle-brave atheling sat on the naze-edge,          while the gold-friend of geatmen gracious saluted          his fireside-companions: woe was his spirit,death-boding, wav'ring; weird very near him,          who must seize the old hero, his soul-treasure look for,          dragging aloof his life from his body:          not flesh-hidden long was the folk-leader's spirit.          beowulf spake, ecgtheow's son:"i survived in my youth-days many a conflict,          hours of onset: that all i remember.          i was seven-winters old when the jewel-prince took me,          high-lord of heroes, at the hands of my father,          hrethel the hero-king had me in keeping,gave me treasure and feasting, our kinship remembered;          not ever was i any less dear to him          knight in the boroughs, than the bairns of his household,          herebald and hæthcyn and higelac mine.          to the eldest unjustly by acts of a kinsmanwas murder-bed strewn, since him hæthcyn from horn-bowhis sheltering chieftain shot with an arrow,          erred in his aim and injured his kinsman,          one brother the other, with blood-sprinkled spear:'twas a feeless fight, finished in malice,sad to his spirit;

then the death-bringing moment          was come to the good one, that the king very warlike,          wielder of weders, with wonder-death perished.          first they beheld there a creature more wondrous,the worm on the field, in front of them lying,          the foeman before them: the fire-spewing dragon,          ghostly and grisly guest in his terrors,          was scorched in the fire; as he lay there he measured          fifty of feet; came forth in the night-timeto rejoice in the air, thereafter departing          to visit his den; he in death was then fastened,          he would joy in no other earth-hollowed caverns.          there stood round about him beakers and vessels,          dishes were lying and dear-valued weapons,with iron-rust eaten, as in earth's mighty bosom          a thousand of winters there they had rested:that mighty bequest then with magic was guarded,          gold of the ancients, that earlman not any          the ring-hall could touch, save ruling-god only,sooth-king of vict'ries gave whom he wished toto open the treasure,          e'en to such among mortals as seemed to him proper.then 'twas seen that the journey prospered him little          who wrongly within had the ornaments hidden          down 'neath the wall. the warden erst slaughtered          some few of the folk-troop: the feud then thereafterwas hotly avengèd. 'tis a wonder where,          when the strength-famous trooper has attained to the end of          life-days allotted, then no longer the man may          remain with his kinsmen where mead-cups are flowing.          so to beowulf happened when the ward of the barrow,assaults, he sought for: himself had no knowledge          how his leaving this life was likely to happen.          so to doomsday, famous folk-leaders down did          call it with curses--who 'complished it there--that that man should be ever of ill-deeds convicted,confined in foul-places, fastened in hell-bonds,          punished with plagues, who this place should e'er ravage.          he cared not for gold: rather the wielder's          favor preferred he first to get sight of.wiglaf discoursed then, wihstan his son:"oft many an earlman on one man's account must          sorrow endure, as to us it hath happened.          the liegelord belovèd we could little prevail on,          kingdom's keeper, counsel to follow,          not to go to the guardian of the gold-hoard, but let himlie where he long was, live in his dwelling          till the end of the world. met we a destiny          hard to endure: the hoard has been looked at,          been gained very grimly;
